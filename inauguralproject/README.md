# Inaugural project

This project examines how income tax influences the consumers behaviour, more specifically consumption and labour supply.
The assignment shows that both consumption and labour supply depends positively on disposable income. Furthermore, the assignment investigates how the total tax revenue is influenced by various parameters such as the Frisch-elasticity for labour-supply. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
